## Contents

The toolbox is included unmodified from its original distribution. The double-nested folder structure (`Inpaint_nans/Inpaint_nans/`) is a known artifact of the original toolbox package. The `demo/`, `doc/`, and `test/` subdirectories, as well as the demo images (`garden50.jpg`, `monet_adresse.jpg`), are part of the original distribution and are included as-is.
